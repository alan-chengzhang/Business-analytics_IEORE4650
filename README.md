Course Materials and homework of IEORE4650_BUSINESS ANALYTICS (Keep updating)

Please be aware that there materials can just be used for personal study. DO NOT use them for profit.

It is a course that I audit in Engineering school, which is a elective course for M.S. of Business Analystics Program. Thanks to the help of Professor Yi Zhang, I get access to these course materials.

The course materials in this course is just like some small project which is used to introduce some topics. As far as I am concerned
the goal of this course is to equip us with businesss sense but not the technical skills. I took many other more technical data science and
machine learing course and had known most technical part in this course but I still find it intersting. It enable me to think about 
different business problems in a data driven way, and use simpy technical methods to analysis and slove problems.

Learning Objectives:

Business analytics refers to the ways in which enterprises such as businesses, non-profits, and governments can use data to gain insights and make better decisions. Business analytics is applied in operations, marketing, finance, and strategic planning among other functions.

In this course, we will learn basic analytic methods that could be applied in business settings. We will also learn how to identify, evaluate, and capture business analytic opportunities that create value. In the first part of the course, we focus on how to use data to develop insights and predictive capabilities using machine learning, data mining, and forecasting techniques. In the second part, we focus on the use of simulation and optimization to support decision-making. Finally, throughout the course, we explore the challenges that can arise in implementing analytical approaches within an organization.

The course emphasizes that business analytics is a practical discipline which requires mastery of both methodology and business applications. The concepts learned in this class should help you identify opportunities in which business analytics can be used to improve performance and support important decisions. It will teach you essential tools that can be used to transform data into high-impact business decisions. Lastly, it should make you alert to the ways that analytics can be used — and misused — within an organization.

We have four learning objectives in this course:

1. Study essential tools and theories that are widely applied to business analytics.
2. Develop the ability to work with real-world datasets using Python.
3. Identify opportunities and ask meaningful questions to help create business values
4. Exercise communication ability and working skills in a group setting.
